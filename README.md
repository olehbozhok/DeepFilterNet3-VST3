# DeepFilterNet3 VST3

DeepFilterNet3 VST3 is a macOS audio plugin that embeds the official DeepFilterNet v0.5.6 model for real-time and offline noise reduction. It exports VST3 and CLAP bundles through nice-plug, accepts mono or stereo tracks, and keeps neural inference and sample-rate conversion on a persistent worker so the host audio callback remains nonblocking.

## Preview

## Features

- Official DeepFilterNet3 low-latency model by default, with the official standard model available as a separate build-time option.
- Mono and stereo input/output layouts with one mono inference stream.
- Arbitrary host block sizes through fixed, timestamped worker chunks.
- Streaming conversion for 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4, and 192 kHz host rates.
- Reported latency with sample-aligned dry/wet mixing.
- The same DSP, resamplers, timeline, and reset protocol in Realtime, Buffered, and Offline modes.
- Lock-free callback transport and a latency-aligned dry fallback when a worker result is late.

## Current validation scope

The current implementation is built and tested on Apple Silicon with macOS
26. Automated validation includes 31 Rust tests and pluginval strictness 5
with callback allocation assertions. pluginval opened the custom editor both
idle and during processing, exercised editor automation plus 44.1, 48, and 96
kHz processing, and completed with `SUCCESS`.

A user-confirmed test in DaVinci Resolve 21 completed a successful Deliver
export with an earlier bundle. That bundle predated the custom editor, so the
result is not UI validation for the current build. The broader repeatability,
interaction, latency, and multi-rate Resolve smoke-test matrix has not yet
been completed. Windows, Linux, and Intel macOS builds have not been
validated.

## Audio behavior

The embedded model always receives one channel:

- Mono input is passed directly to inference.
- Stereo input is downmixed as `(left + right) / 2` for inference.
- The mono wet result is copied to both stereo outputs.
- Each stereo channel retains its own dry signal before the aligned dry/wet mix.

The plugin delays both dry and wet output to the reported latency. During startup or a real-time worker underrun, the affected samples use dry audio from the same delayed timestamp instead of silence or a stale wet frame. Offline mode uses the same worker pipeline and may wait up to two seconds for the required timestamped result.

If sustained overload exhausts the input queue, the worker automatically restarts from recent audio. The dry timeline stays continuous during recovery; enhancement resumes when valid results are available again.

Unsupported sample-rate or host-buffer geometry, model startup failure, and other initialization failures select unchanged direct bypass with zero reported latency.

## Latency

Latency is calculated from live model metadata, both resamplers, and the host's maximum block size. The collection/inference reserve is `(ceil(maximum block size / host quantum) + 1) * host quantum`, so a full callback can be queued without immediately requiring its results. Latency stays fixed until reinitialization and is reported to the host for compensation. The official low-latency model has a 48 kHz FFT size of 960, hop size of 480, zero lookahead, and 480 samples of intrinsic model delay.

The following impulse results use a negotiated maximum block size of **1024 samples**:

| Host rate | Host quantum | Reported latency | Impulse validation |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| 44.1 kHz | 441 samples | 2,646 samples (60 ms) | Within 1 sample |
| 48 kHz | 480 samples | 2,400 samples (50 ms) | Exact |
| 96 kHz | 960 samples | 4,800 samples (50 ms) | Within 1 sample |

Mix values of 0%, 50%, and 100% remain peak-aligned at the reported latency. The other declared rates use the same checked formula and streaming converter geometry.

At 48 kHz, maximum blocks of 128, 512, and 4096 samples report 30, 40, and 110 ms respectively. The host's negotiated maximum, not merely the size of the current callback, determines the reserve.

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 26.x or later for the validated configuration.
- Rust 1.95 or later to build the pinned framework and egui dependencies.
- A VST3- or CLAP-compatible host.

The build downloads Rust dependencies and the pinned official DeepFilterNet v0.5.6 source/model archive.

## Build and model selection

Clone the repository and build the default low-latency model:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shuichi346/DeepFilterNet3-VST3.git
cd DeepFilterNet3-VST3
cargo xtask bundle deepfilter-vst --release --features plugin
```

Generated bundles:

```text
target/bundled/deepfilter-vst.vst3
target/bundled/deepfilter-vst.clap
```

To build the official standard model instead of the default low-latency model:

```bash
cargo xtask bundle deepfilter-vst --release --no-default-features --features plugin,model-standard
```

The model features are mutually exclusive. Exactly one of `model-ll` or `model-standard` must be enabled.

The VST3/CLAP layer itself is the non-default `plugin` feature, so every
`cargo xtask bundle` command must name it. A build without `plugin` is the
DeepFilterNet core library: `dsp`, `model`, `resampler`, and `worker`, with
`DspCore`, `DfEngine`, `RatePlan`, and `WorkerHandle` at the crate root, and no
nice-plug, nice-plug-egui, or egui in the dependency graph. Another project
consumes it as a dependency with `default-features = false` and picks a model
feature explicitly, or none at all to load `DEEPFILTER_MODEL` at run time.

## Install

For a user-only VST3 installation on macOS:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3"
cp -R target/bundled/deepfilter-vst.vst3 "$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/"
```

For CLAP hosts:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP"
cp -R target/bundled/deepfilter-vst.clap "$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/"
```

Restart or rescan the host after installation. Local builds are not distributed with a Developer ID signature or Apple notarization.

## Usage

1. Build and install the VST3 or CLAP bundle, then restart or rescan the host.
2. Add **DeepFilter Noise Reduction** to a mono or stereo audio track.
3. Open the plug-in editor. It contains only **Attenuation Limit** and **Mix** sliders.
4. Leave **Mix** at 100% for the fully enhanced signal, or reduce it to blend in the latency-aligned dry channel.
5. Adjust **Attenuation Limit** to cap the amount of noise attenuation. A 0 dB setting selects aligned raw audio while keeping model state advancing.

The host receives the plugin's calculated latency during initialization. If the requested host configuration is unsupported, the plugin remains available but passes audio through unchanged and reports zero latency.

The compact custom editor and host-generated parameter panels both control the
same two automatable parameters. Host automation and external parameter
changes remain synchronized with the sliders.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Default | Behavior |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| Attenuation Limit | 0–100 dB | 100 dB | Limits the attenuation applied by DeepFilterNet, with 50 ms smoothing advanced in audio-sample time and applied per callback. At effectively 0 dB, the model still advances while the aligned raw path is selected. |
| Mix | 0–100% | 100% | Blends latency-aligned per-channel dry audio with the mono wet result. |

## Development and testing

Build a debug bundle with nice-plug's callback allocation assertions:

```bash
cargo xtask bundle deepfilter-vst --features plugin,nice-plug/assert_process_allocs
```

Run the bounded library and plugin validation gate:

```bash
cargo test -p deepfilter-vst --lib && \
/Applications/pluginval.app/Contents/MacOS/pluginval \
  --strictness-level 5 \
  --validate-in-process \
  target/bundled/deepfilter-vst.vst3
```

The VST3 bundle used for pluginval should be the allocation-asserting debug artifact from the preceding command.

Create the Apple Silicon release package after building the release bundles:

```bash
cargo xtask bundle deepfilter-vst --release --features plugin
./scripts/package-release.sh
```

The script reads the version from `plugin/Cargo.toml`. You can also pass an explicit version:

```bash
./scripts/package-release.sh 0.7.0
```

It verifies that both bundles are thin arm64 binaries with valid ad-hoc signatures, then creates:

```text
dist/DeepFilterNR-v0.7.0-macos-arm64.zip
dist/DeepFilterNR-v0.7.0-macos-arm64.zip.sha256
```

The ZIP contains both plug-in bundles, installation instructions, required
license notices, and checksums. Existing packages are never overwritten. The
script does not install or publish anything.

`PLANS.md` records the implementation and validation evidence. `CHANGELOG.md`
and `NOTES.md` record release and maintenance information.

## Troubleshooting

If a host keeps discovering an older local build, clean and recreate the release bundle before reinstalling it:

```bash
cargo clean
cargo xtask bundle deepfilter-vst --release --features plugin
```

Confirm that the VST3 or CLAP directory matches the installation paths above, then restart or rescan the host. A locally built bundle is not Developer ID signed or notarized, so macOS host security behavior may differ from a distributed signed plugin.

## Known limitations

- The wet path is mono by design; stereo spatial differences remain only in the dry contribution.
- Real-time scheduling delays can temporarily substitute aligned dry audio for missing enhanced output.
- Worker/model startup is bounded to ten seconds; a startup failure selects direct bypass.
- Unsupported rate or buffer configurations select direct bypass rather than resampling approximately.
- A successful Deliver export has been user-confirmed in DaVinci Resolve 21, but the full repeatability, interaction, latency, and multi-rate host matrix remains unverified.
- Only the Apple Silicon macOS configuration described above has been validated.
